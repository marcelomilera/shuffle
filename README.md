# shuffle

Simple CLI application that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 in random order to the terminal.
  
This application uses an implementation of the "inside-out" variant of the [Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_%22inside-out%22_algorithm) to generate a random permutation of the input sequence.

Developed using **Go** version go1.12.6
